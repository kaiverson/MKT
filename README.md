Manage Kai's Tasks (MKT)
written entirely by Kai Iverson, entirely in rust!

I know that there are plenty of other task managers,
I just wanted to get experience designing and creating useful software.

Here is a list of things that I learned about while making this project:
1. How to make a project in rust.
2. How to make command line interface software.
3. How to manage data in a file.
4. How to unit test my software thouroughly.
